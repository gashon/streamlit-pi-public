A clear plastic tub containing a yellow plastic cup rests on a wooden table, surrounded by various items including a beige ceramic bowl with a spoon, a beige ceramic cup, a black tray, a white molded pulp takeout container, and an orange plastic cup; a blue plastic-lined bin is positioned at the back-center of the table. The robotic arm, initially holding a blue plastic cup, moves downwards, precisely positioning the blue cup over the yellow plastic cup inside the tub. The arm then lowers the blue cup, placing it inside the yellow cup, and subsequently opens its gripper to release it before retracting upwards and away.  Following this, the robot arm maneuvers towards the center-right of the table, lowers its gripper over the white molded pulp takeout container, and closes its gripper to grasp the container. The arm then lifts the white takeout container, moves it towards the blue plastic-lined bin at the back-center of the table, positions it over the bin's opening, and opens its gripper, releasing the container into the bin; the arm remains over the bin with its gripper open as the sequence ends.
A silver robotic arm is positioned above a white tabletop cluttered with various items, including a black rectangular tray at the back-center, a light blue cup at the center-right, and a white paper towel roll at the far back-left. To the right of the table, a blue rectangular bin with a clear bag stands ready. The robot, initially holding a clear/translucent cup, lowers this cup into the black rectangular tray and opens its gripper to release it. The arm then pivots and extends its end-effector towards the light blue cup positioned at the center-right of the table; the gripper descends over the light blue cup, closes around its body, lifts it clear of the table, and then moves it horizontally before lowering and releasing it into the same black rectangular tray. Next, the robot rotates and reaches towards the white paper towel roll at the far back-left, lowers its gripper to encompass the roll, closes its gripper to secure it, and lifts it upwards; the arm then swings the grasped paper towel roll towards the blue rectangular bin on the right and opens its gripper, causing the roll to drop onto the table surface adjacent to the bin.
A gray and light blue robotic arm is positioned to the right of a wooden table. On the table, a black rectangular tray sits in the center, containing a red plastic cup (with a clear cup nested inside), a blue plastic bowl, a white plastic spoon, and a silver metal fork; other items on the table include a purple and white round container, a black marker, and a black smartphone at the front-left, with a light green plate at the center-back and a pink plate at the right-back.  The robot arm initially moves its gripper downwards and towards the light green plate, closing its gripper around the plate's edge. It then lifts the light green plate and maneuvers it over the black rectangular tray, subsequently lowering and releasing the plate into the tray. After retracting its gripper, the robot arm then shifts its gripper towards the pink plate, lowers it onto the plate, and closes its gripper around the edge, beginning to lift the pink plate as the sequence ends.
A robotic arm is stationed to the right of a wooden table, which holds a brown paper bag at its front-left, a yellow rectangular box and a white cylindrical plant pot in the center, an orange bow at the center-right, and a brown paper-wrapped object at the back-right. A black rectangular bin is positioned in the back-left area, behind the table. The robot's end effector first descends towards the back-right of the table, aligning over the brown paper-wrapped object. Its gripper then lowers further, closes to secure this object, and elevates it from the tabletop. Subsequently, the arm sweeps the grasped object leftwards, positioning it above the black rectangular bin and then lowering it, before the gripper opens to release the object towards the bin; the arm concludes by ascending and shifting slightly rightward, retracting from the bin area.
A wooden table in the foreground features a brown paper grocery bag standing on its left side, a purple and white plastic food bag positioned at its center-back, and a white and orange flattened cardboard package resting in its center, with dark debris scattered across the center and right areas. Behind the table, a grey rectangular plastic tub is visible on a cart. A robotic arm enters the frame from the right, extends towards the center-back of the table, and positions its gripper directly above the purple and white plastic food bag. The gripper then descends, grasps the plastic food bag, lifts it vertically, and moves it towards the brown paper grocery bag on the left, releasing the food bag over the grocery bag's opening, causing it to fall inside.  Subsequently, the arm retracts from the grocery bag, moves towards the center of the table, and positions its gripper over the white and orange flattened cardboard packaging. It grasps the packaging, lifts it, and carries it towards the brown paper grocery bag, releasing the packaging over the opening, allowing it to drop into the bag. Finally, the arm moves away from the grocery bag, shifts towards the center of the table, and hovers its gripper above the dark scattered debris, making small adjusting movements as the video ends.
In a workshop setting, a blue and gray patterned rug is positioned on a wooden surface in the foreground. A clear plastic rectangular container rests on this rug, and a light gray bowl is situated inside the container.  No robot or robotic arm is visible in the video frame. The light gray bowl remains stationary inside the clear plastic rectangular container throughout the sequence. Similarly, the container itself does not move from its position on the rug, and no interaction with either object occurs.
A gray and light blue robotic arm is positioned over a wooden table. On the table, a clear plastic rectangular container is situated at the front-left, a yellow, green, and white patterned rectangular placemat is located at the center-right, and a black rectangular container is positioned at the back-right. The robot's end effector, initially grasping a white plate with a white napkin inside the clear plastic container, lifts these items upwards and slightly to the right. The arm then maneuvers the plate and napkin horizontally towards the black rectangular container, lowers them into this container, and releases its grip. Following this, the arm retracts vertically, sweeps in an arc first towards the front-left and then towards the center-right of the table, positioning its end effector above the patterned placemat before descending to make contact and press down onto the placemat's surface.
On a cluttered table, a grey rectangular tray sits center-left, surrounded by various items including a beige circular plate, a light blue bowl, a black cylindrical cup, an orange plate, a grey cylindrical cup, a yellow and orange snack wrapper, a black smartphone, a teal cylindrical cup, a silver fork, a blue cylindrical object, a peach-colored bowl, and a black bowl. To the left of the table, a blue rectangular trash can with a blue liner is visible.  A robotic arm extends its gripper downwards and towards the center of the table, hovering directly above the yellow and orange snack wrapper. The gripper then descends, closes around the snack wrapper, and lifts it upwards. The arm smoothly transports the grasped wrapper leftwards, arcing towards the blue trash can, positions it over the opening, and then releases the wrapper, allowing it to fall inside. Finally, the robot arm retracts upwards and to the right, away from the trash can, and then moves further upwards and to the right before coming to a stationary position.
The scene features a cluttered table surface populated with various items, including a silver laptop at the back-left, cleaning supplies, and numerous pieces of dishware; notably, a light blue ceramic round plate holding a knife and fork is situated in the mid-left area, while a grey rectangular plastic dish tub containing cutlery rests in the mid-right. A robotic arm, initially positioned above the grey dish tub, descends with its open gripper moving into the tub amongst the cutlery. The gripper then closes within the tub, though no object is visibly secured, and the arm subsequently ascends, lifting the closed, empty gripper out of the tub. The arm then maneuvers the closed gripper from the dish tub towards the mid-left of the table, positioning it above the light blue plate, lowers towards the plate, and opens its gripper over it, without any object being visibly released, before retracting upwards and finally repositioning itself to hover above the dish tub with its gripper open as the video concludes.
A gray and light blue robotic arm is positioned over a light brown wooden table, which features a silver and white metal shelving unit in the center holding multiple green and black cylindrical cans. In the front-center area of the table, one green and black cylindrical can rests directly on the surface, while another identical can is held by the robot's gripper; further back, a light brown wooden box supports a silver stapler, a green roll of tape, and a black pen.  The robot arm, already gripping a green and black cylindrical can, lowers this can directly downwards. The bottom surface of the held can makes contact with the top surface of the stationary green and black cylindrical can resting on the table. Immediately following the contact, the robot arm, still maintaining its grip on the can, elevates the held can upwards and shifts it slightly to its own left (the camera's right), moving it away from the can on the table, and then holds its position.
A wooden table is set with a brown wooden cutlery tray positioned towards the center-left, containing silver forks in its leftmost compartment, silver spoons in the center, and silver knives in the rightmost compartment; additional loose silver spoons, knives, and forks are arranged on the tabletop to the right of the tray. A blue plastic basket is visible to the left of the table, and a dark green cylindrical bin is situated under the table on the right.  A robotic system is present in the vicinity of the table. Throughout the entire video sequence, the robot remains completely stationary. No part of the robot moves, and it does not interact with or cause any movement of the cutlery tray, the individual utensils, or any other objects on or near the table.
A robotic arm is positioned over a light-colored wooden table. On the table, a yellowish spice jar is at the front-left, a dark spice jar is in the middle-left, and a greenish spice jar is also in the middle-left. A white wire spice rack, already holding several spice jars on its top and bottom tiers, is located in the center of the table; two blue rectangular bins are visible behind the table.  The robot arm, initially hovering above the spice rack, sweeps downwards and towards the front-left of the table, positioning its gripper directly over the yellowish spice jar. The gripper descends and closes around the body of the yellowish spice jar, lifts it vertically, and then arcs upwards and towards the white wire spice rack. The arm carefully maneuvers the jar over an empty spot on the top tier of the rack, to the left of an existing greenish spice jar, lowers it into place, and then opens its gripper to release the jar. The robot arm then retracts upwards, moving away from the spice rack.
On a wooden tabletop, three cylindrical bins are arranged: a white bin with a blue plastic liner on the left, a white bin with a light green plastic liner in the center, and a black bin with a black plastic liner on the right; a white paper napkin is positioned on the table to the left of the bins, with a clear plastic container and a blue and white food package visible on an adjacent lower surface to the far left, and some white paper scraps are scattered in the foreground. A silver and black robotic arm, featuring light blue joints, enters the scene from the top-right, descends, and precisely positions its gripper above the white paper napkin. The gripper then lowers to make contact, securely grasps the napkin, and lifts it clear of the table. Subsequently, the arm smoothly transports the napkin horizontally to the right, hovers it over the central white bin (lined with a light green plastic bag), and then opens its gripper, releasing the napkin to drop into the bin, where the arm remains as the video concludes.
A fisheye camera captures an overhead view of a room where a person sits at a desk with a laptop. On the wooden table, a white and grey/blue mat is positioned center-left, a silver laptop is at the front-right, a black rectangular device is center-right, and two blue cylindrical objects are at the back-right. A black rectangular bin is situated on the floor to the left of the table.  The robotic arm, initially at rest, extends its gripper from its starting position towards the black rectangular device located on the table. The arm then lowers its empty gripper directly over the device and closes it, firmly grasping a blue rectangular object from within the black rectangular device. Lifting this blue object clear, the arm then sweeps it leftwards, moving it from its position on the table towards the black rectangular bin on the floor. The arm descends, positioning the grasped blue object over the bin, and then opens its gripper, releasing the object to fall towards the bin. After retracting upwards, the arm maneuvers back over the table surface and advances towards one of the blue cylindrical objects at the back-right of the table, lowering its empty gripper and closing it around the cylindrical object.
A robotic arm is positioned above a light brown wooden table, on which a black shoe sole is located at the center-left, another black shoe sole is in the center, and a black shoe with blue sole accents rests at the center-right. To the left of the table is a black rectangular case, and a brown cardboard box is visible inside an open black case positioned behind the table.  The robot arm, with its gripper already open, lowers towards the black shoe with blue sole accents at the center-right of the table. The gripper then closes around the mid-section of the black shoe. Subsequently, the robot arm lifts the grasped shoe slightly upwards, clearing it from the table surface, and then moves it further upwards and slightly away from its initial position, holding it suspended in the air.
A wooden table is set up with a white pegboard behind it, where a tan masking tape roll is hung at the top-left and a silver putty knife is mounted at the center-bottom. Various tools, including a white paint roller, a silver and tan handsaw, a black and red trowel, a purple and white tape roll, and a black electrical tape roll, are scattered across the tabletop, which is flanked by blue rectangular bins on either side.  A robotic arm, initially partially visible in the upper right, glides downwards and arcs towards the center of the table, its larger grey segments subsequently shifting further into view from the right as it reorients above the central part of the table. The arm then smoothly extends its end effector downwards and towards the front-left area, precisely positioning it directly above the purple and white tape roll and the black electrical tape roll. The end effector hovers in close proximity over these two tape rolls for an extended duration without initiating any physical contact, before finally retracting vertically, sweeping slightly towards the center and then further towards the right, and continuing its upward and rightward retraction away from the table, largely exiting the central view.
A light blue and silver robotic arm operates above a wooden table. Positioned on the back-left of the table is a white wire drawer unit, with its top drawer holding a light grey rolled cloth on the left and a brown/grey rolled cloth on the right. At the front-right of the table, a dark blue/black folded cloth lies on top of a blue and white checkered folded cloth, while a black cylindrical trash bin stands to the left of the table.  The robot arm, initially grasping a small orange/red cylindrical object with its gripper positioned inside the top drawer of the white wire unit (on the left side, near the light grey rolled cloth), first lifts the object upwards and pulls it backwards, extracting it from the drawer. The arm then retracts further, pulling the object completely clear of the drawer unit, before pivoting its end-effector to the right and subsequently lowering the grasped object towards the dark blue/black folded cloth. Finally, the gripper opens, releasing the small orange/red cylindrical object onto or in the immediate vicinity of the dark blue/black folded cloth, and the arm then holds its position above the release point.
A silver and light blue robotic arm is initially positioned above a light brown wooden table. On the table, a brown glass bottle is at the center-left, a red tomato and a yellow plastic bottle are in the center, and a yellow banana is at the front-center; an open, empty white refrigerator is visible in the background to the right. The robot arm, with the camera mounted on it, initially hovers over the objects, then smoothly arcs upwards and to its right, moving away from the table and eventually positioning its camera to view both the table below and the open refrigerator directly in front. While the arm remains stationary in this new position, its black end effector enters the camera's field of view from the top right and begins a sequence of repeatedly opening and closing its grippers. Throughout the sequence, the robot arm does not make contact with any of the items on the table.
A gray robotic arm operates above a light brown wooden table, where a pink plastic-wrapped item is located at the front-left and a brown cardboard box, filled with white paper towels, an orange and white patterned bag, and a green and blue packaged item, sits at the center-right. The robot arm initially lowers its gripper downwards and towards the pink plastic-wrapped item on the front-left of the table. The gripper then orients itself above the item and closes, pinching the top surface of the pink plastic-wrapped item. Subsequently, the arm elevates the grasped item vertically, then sweeps it horizontally to the right, positioning it directly over the open brown cardboard box. Finally, the arm descends, lowering the pink item into the box where it comes to rest on top of the other contents, before the gripper opens to release it, and the arm retracts upwards, moving away from the box.
A wooden rectangular table displays four white cups with black lids: one at the back-right, one at the back-center, one at the front-right, and one at the front-center, alongside a brown cardboard cup holder positioned at the center-left of the tabletop. A dark green rectangular bin is situated to the left of the table, and a blue plastic bag is visible underneath the table towards the center.  A robotic arm enters the frame from the top right, descends towards the white cup with a black lid located at the back-right of the table, and its gripper closes around the body of this cup. The arm then lifts the cup vertically, arcs it towards the center-left over the table, and precisely lowers it into an empty slot within the brown cardboard cup holder. After placing the cup, the gripper opens to release it, and the arm remains stationary, hovering directly above the cup in the holder as the video concludes.
A dark tabletop is cluttered with various items, including a yellow and a blue plastic cup in the back-left, a white plastic cutting board on the left, a beige ceramic bowl in the center-left, crumpled aluminum foil in the front-left, and a blue ceramic bowl in the center; a grey rectangular trash can is positioned at the back, and a clear rectangular plastic bin containing a blue plastic plate is on the right side of the table. A robotic arm, with a grey and light blue articulated structure, enters the frame from the bottom right, extending upwards and arcing towards the front-center of the table where a beige ceramic plate rests. The robot's gripper descends and orients itself around the beige ceramic plate, then closes to secure a firm grip on its edges. The arm lifts the plate vertically, then smoothly transports it to the right, carefully lowers it into the clear rectangular plastic bin (where it lands on the blue plastic plate), and opens its gripper to release the plate. Subsequently, the arm retracts upwards and begins to move back towards the center of the table, positioning its gripper to hover above the blue ceramic bowl as the video concludes.
A clear rectangular plastic bin, holding a light green and blue plastic cup and a light pink plastic plate, is situated on the left side of a dark tabletop. Various items, including a white plastic spoon, a light pink ceramic bowl, a black and white food wrapper, a red and brown food wrapper, a white plastic fork, a light blue ceramic bowl (initially under the robot's end effector), a potted plant, and a brown paper bag, are distributed across the table, with a grey rectangular plastic bin located at the back-right.  The robotic arm, starting above the light blue ceramic bowl, lowers its end effector to grasp the bowl, lifts it, then smoothly transports it to the grey rectangular plastic bin and releases it inside, before moving slightly upwards. Subsequently, the arm moves towards the red and brown food wrapper, descends to pick it up, lifts it clear of the table, carries it over to the grey bin, and drops it in, again moving upwards. To conclude, the robot navigates to the brown paper bag, lowers its gripper to secure the bag, lifts it, moves it above the grey bin, releases the bag, and then ascends away from the bin.
